					<p class="desc font-white">We’re excited to announce that Search Delphi has been acquired by Atieh Capital. <br> <br>

We started in 2018 with the overarching vision of a world where anyone could easily tap into the world’s collective knowledge using digital connectivity. 

Over time, we focused our energy on building infrastructure to automate and efficiently source and qualify knowledge that is hidden and buried in the minds of individuals around the world. <br> <br>

This move allows us to expand our footprint in Europe and enhance service to Atieh Capital’s consulting, asset management, private equity, and corporate clients. <br> <br>

Our product achieved meaningful results and traction with help from Jon Levy @ Y Combinator, the Gates Foundation, Inex One, Deloitte, and Norton Rose Fulbright. <br> <br>



We are grateful and thankful for the opportunity to see how our vision will grow under this larger organization. <br> <br>

Thank you to everyone who helped us on this journey.
